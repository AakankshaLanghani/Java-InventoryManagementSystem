# Java-InventoryManagementSystem

This project aims to develop an inventory management system using your choice of arrays or linked lists. The system should allow you to manage product information and perform various operations to maintain accurate stock levels.

**Data Structure:**
Products: You can choose to represent products using either: 
Array: Create an array of Product objects. Each Product object would contain attributes like product ID (unique identifier), name, price, quantity, etc.
Linked List: Implement a linked list where each node holds a Product object with the same attributes.
 
**Functionalities:**
**Add Product:** Implement a method to add a new product to the inventory. This might involve:
a)Prompting the user for product details (name, price, quantity).
b)Creating a new Product object with the provided information.
c)Adding the object to the chosen data structure (array or linked list).
 
**Remove Product:** Develop a method to remove an existing product from the inventory. You might need to:
a)Allow the user to search for a product by ID or name.
b)Locate the product in the data structure (array or linked list).
c)Remove the product object from the data structure.

**Search Product:** Implement a method to search for a product based on various criteria:
a)Search by product ID.
b)Search by product name (potentially using a partial match).
 
**Sort Products:** Design methods to sort the inventory based on different criteria:
a)Sort by product name (alphabetical order).
b)Sort by product price (ascending or descending).
c)Sort by product quantity (low to high or high to low).
